This folder will should contain templates used to generate pages with like for example headers, footers, or maybe surten contentboxes.

Templates should be able to contain any type of code, css, html or php since i send them to just "include" like in c++, basicly paste
them in before i serve them.

Use .'s to mark folders or slashes(which marks folders) if they want to have multiple folders the keep templates seperated

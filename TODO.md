# TODO

- [ ] Figure out a way to know when generated files need to be updated when caching is enabled.
- [ ] Build a error system to give more exact locations of webdeq errors rather than the php standard errors who are in the absolutely wrong place.
- [ ] Add developermode setting so that we can choose weather or not to give proper errors or just "something went wrong" to the client.
- [ ] Test the deq-var feature that is featured in the php-example page, it works but is unstable, also clear all the php errors from that feature.

# DONE

- [x] Add a variable system to the templating system ( CURRENTLY VERY UNSTABLE BUT WORKING)
